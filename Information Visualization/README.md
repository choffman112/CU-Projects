This folder contains my project work related to the BIOS 7719 Information Visualization class in the Department of Biosatistics and Informatics at the Colorado School of Public Health (CU Anschutz). My final project involved designing an interactive R Shiny dashboard analyzing CDC opioid mortality data across all 50 U.S. states from 2015-2024. The end users for this project include public health  and medical experts (i.e., clinicians, epidemiologists) as well as the general public. Goals include raising public awareness on the dangers of opioids and unearth potential trends in mortality across the nation over the past decade (2015-2024). While this project is intended to be exploratory and hypothesis-generating, there is the potential to draw some associations; for example, public health experts may be able to extract whether the development of local/state policies and legislation led to a change in mortality surrounding opioid use. Perhaps the initiation of new treatment programs and improved accessibility to drug rehabiliation centers are associated with an overall decrease in mortality related ot opioid use.
