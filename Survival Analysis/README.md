# Background

This project folder contains my final project from University of Colorado's Survival Analysis class (BIOS 6646). My project topic looked at the use of Bayesian and Frequentist Accelerated time Failure (AFT) models in evaluating the time to hospitalization (as well as length of hospitalization stays) in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF).
